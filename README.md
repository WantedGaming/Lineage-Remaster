# Lineage-Remaster
text files for the lineage remaster 2019 client 


The client is from 2019, when lineage remaster was first launched in Korea.  I do not know what client version it is.

1. All files should be dropped into the "data" folder inside your lineage client directory.
2. If you do not have a folder "data" in your client directory, just created one.
3. You will need a patcher to update the client (on your own there).
