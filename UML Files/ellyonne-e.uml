		<p>For a long time I have studied magic with Talas in the Ivory Tower. It seems like yesterday when we were happy to recreate elemental magic.</p>
		<p>But now I have to be even purer myself, and I am back here again.</p>
		<p>Coming back to the elven forest again, I miss the convenience I felt in the human world.</p>
		<p>I can use most things if I teach and ask my elven forest friends, but I couldn't teach their magic to the elves. Just like they can't use spirit magic.</p>
		<p>I had no choice but to ask my old friend and colleague Talas to send a wizard from the Ivory Tower to the Elven Forest.</p>
		<p>Endre there is just that wizard.</p>
