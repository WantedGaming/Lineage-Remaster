    <p> My name is Flora, a messenger. In this world, light and darkness coexist. We live in Aden, a very rich and peaceful place, but behind the scenes, evil, injustice, and corruption are rampant.<br/></p>
    <p><a action="teleportURL">Understood. Send me there.</a></p><br/>
    <p> The bodies of the drifters were buried as nameless ones, but "Maya", the dark wizard of the court, dug up the buried bodies and turned them into undead. Poor thing...
 They were rendered incapable of dying. When this fact was discovered, "Maya" had already made her decision.
 But too many souls are suffering. We must quickly defeat "Maya" and save their undead souls.
 Save their souls from being turned into undead.</p>
