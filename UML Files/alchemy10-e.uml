    <p>When demons such as Demon, Beleth, and Baphomet are defeated, they shed jet-black blood, a sign of their race, although it is very rare. This is what is called "black bloodstain.</p><br/>
    <p>Besides demons, the dark elves who use the power of demons also have these black bloodstains. This will allow them to separate the four types of elemental stones.<br/><br/><br/></p>
