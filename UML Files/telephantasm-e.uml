		<p>You have a youth that I do not have, and I can teach you things that you do not yet know.</p>
		<p>If you give this poor Edren some adena, I will share knowledge to the dreams.</p>
		<p>You can then awaken your own subconscious, which you do not even know yet.</p>
		<p>You know what they say, what you dream about comes true.</p>
		<p>The experience there is located between dream and reality, so it will satisfy your adventurous spirit.</p>
