		 <p>Forgotten Islands is where even the most skilled adventurers fear to tread.</p>
		<p>With your current skills I think it's a bit early to go to the Forgotten Island, don't you? I think you'd better get more experiences before you go there. Come back again.</p>
		<p>One more thing. Please remember that it is not a place where you can casually go just because it is strong.</p>
