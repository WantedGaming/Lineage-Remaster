		<p>People call me Ellyonne. As you can see, I am an elf.</p>
		<p>I don't know if it was just the influence of a gruff, positive human being, but I suddenly ran out of the elven forest. I wonder how long it has been since then.</p>

		<p>The guardians who always greeted me happily in the elven forest... the smell of the mother tree that seemed to seep into my heart... but I seem to have forgotten the taste of the fruit of the ent.</p>
