		<p>Fire is the element that symbolizes the purest power.</p>
		<p>It has the power to burn all the energy it has in itself to destroy and purify everything else.</p>
		<p>So it is said that the characteristics of fire elemental magic are the most aggressive of the four attributes.</p>
		<p>If you want to strengthen your ability to defeat enemies mainly with daggers, the most correct choice would be to choose the fire family.</p>
