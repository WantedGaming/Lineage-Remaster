		Brave man, help me!<br/><br/>
		The Ice Queen and her men made a mess of the village of Patarasi.<br/>
		We tried to protect it somehow, but it was beyond our ability to do so.<br/>
		<br/>
		If you kill a bad monster and bring me a <font fg="ffffaf">cold snowflake</font> as proof, I'll be sure to repay you!<br/>
		Yes, I know our village is a bit cold for the brave men, so take one of those <font fg="ffffaf">warm ruby pocket hearths</font> with you!<br/>
		We'll be waiting for you then!<br/></p>
