		<p>Welcome.<br/>
		<br/>
		To celebrate the 19th Anniversary of Aden, the King has prepared <font fg="ffffaf">a gift.</font><br/>
		But last night, not only did bandits steal all our gifts, but the seasons changed...<br/>
		Luckily, the Wizards of the Ivory Tower cast a spell on me to keep the Light of the Gift from disappearing.<br/>
		<br/>
		<font fg="ffffaf">Eliminate Bandits</font>in the Mysterious Seasonal Forest.
		Find the gift that <font fg="ffffaf">lost it's Light</font> for me.<br/>
		<br/>
		The gifts that have <font fg="ffffaf">lost it's Light</font>can regain it by using the Golden Key or the Silver Key.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Elimate the Bandits in Mysterious Seasonal Forest and get <font fg="ffffaf">100 19th Anniversary Coins</font>as evidence.<br/>
		Visit Lord Taras and he'll give you a worthy reward.<br/>
		<br/>
		Well then, I wish you the best of luck.<br/>
