		<p>The earth is so quiet that everyone tends to forget that they are even on the ground all the time, but no one can ignore their power!</p>
		<p>The spirit magic that borrows power from this earth will give it solidity as well as the huge earth.</p>
		<p>Just like a mother raising her children, the very power of Mother Earth for all of us will protect those who use it.</p>
