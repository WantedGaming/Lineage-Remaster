	<p>They'll get <font fg="ffafff">damaged</font> when you attack something hard like a castle gate with your sword and chip the blade, 
	or when you fight a monster that corrodes your weapons and armor!</p>
	<p>It's also foolish to fight something as hard as a <font fg="ffafff">Stone Golem</font>
	with weapons like sword and spears!</p><br/>
    <p>Since the weapon is not doing proper damage, it may break.</p>
	<p>A <font fg="ffafff">blunt weapon</font> like an Axe or a Morningstar won't hurt a hard one!</p>
