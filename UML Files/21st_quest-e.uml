		I'm glad you came.<br/>
		<br/>
		I heard that the bandits stole all the king's gifts...?<br/>
		Be sure to defeat the guys who ruined the heroes' spring walk by changing the seasons.<br/>
		<br/>
		The gifts obtained by killing the bandits can be used to restore the lost light
		by using the <font fg="ffffaf">19th Anniversary Golden Key and the 19th Anniversary Silver Key.</font>
		<br/>

		If you bring a <font fg="ffffaf">Festival Participation Form</font> and <font fg="ffffaf">100 19th Anniversary Coins</font> as proof that you are the one who 
		defeated the bandit, we will give you a special reward.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The EXP of the reward for your growth is based on <font fg="ffffaf">level 52.</font>  If you are under level 60
		you may come back after leveling some.<br/>
