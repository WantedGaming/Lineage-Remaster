   <p>This is a dueling arena. This is where you can fight not only monsters but also other adventurers.</p><br/>
   <p>Once inside, it is a place where <font fg="ffffff">adventurers are allowed to attack each other.</font> If you want to go inside with that in mind, I will send you inside.</p><br/>
   <p>Please note, however, that once inside, you are responsible for any unforeseen circumstances that may arise.<br/><br/></p>
